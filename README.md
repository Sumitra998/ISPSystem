# ISPSystem
 This ISP (internet service provider) project needs you to build a system that delivers automated troubleshooting, and error messages to the consumer. The project also needs you to link the communication systems between the server and the ISP. It comprises four automation modules like the user login module, hardware and software modules, the service module, and a connection module. You will have to use Java technology, and J2EE to create this system.
